Enhanced Project Description: Intelligent Surveillance System with Deep Learning Integration
  This project, developed under the guidance of Inlustro, focuses on leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques to build an intelligent, automated surveillance system. Designed to enhance security and       
  minimize human effort in monitoring, the system combines the capabilities of advanced object detection models and real-time video analytics with intuitive alarm mechanisms. It ensures proactive responses to 
  potential security breaches by identifying and reacting to unauthorized activities within predefined areas.
